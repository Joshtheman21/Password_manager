# This application here is for people who are terrible at creating passwords. I for one reside as one of those people haha. This application allows you to create your password or have one generated for you using the Tkinter module in Python. There's also a package module I imported called "pyperclip" which allows for your password to be automatically copied into your clipboard, that's if you generate the password. Try it out and let me know what you think! 

#UPDATE this code is now used in a JSON format and I added in exceptions. There is a new button Search that allows you to search for one of your accounts. For example, you typed in the website, email, and password. You can now search the name of the website you put down and it'll give you the email and password you assigned to it.
